Dear fellow Exes, thank your for your overwhelming response to the JW lawsuit against my publisher and book, and John Redwood's article. As one particular question (in fact: two questions) has popped up repeatedly, I thought it would be easier to answer it in a separate posting instead of copy pasting it under every comment. So please excuse the spam. EDIT: Here is the article from John Redwood that explains the whole situation http://jwsurvey.org/news/goodbye-jehovah-hello-courtroom-watchtower. This is an authorized Web site of Jehovah's Witnesses. It is a research tool for publications in various languages produced by Jehovah's Witnesses. This morning was the first in joining Reddit, reading the comments, and responding. Just had a major breakdown this morning which led to joining to be able to have an outlet. It is as if you do not have your life because what you build who you are is out of JWs org. Am faded, still talk a bit to some that I have had a long term relationship with.

Предыдущее посещение: Вт апр 23, 2019 6:25 am: Текущее время: Вт апр Gotta love feedback from Jehovah's Witnesses (on an article about undue influence exerted on children): "Worst FB group iv ever seen. So petty bitter and godless. I feel sorry for you. I grew up In it too. Set very smart Morales for me. The children are so good, intelligent, why make a whole group of Haters?! What's wrong with you? Their is a lot more problems in this world. All they want to do is save you! Get a clue! Bitter petty group." Spot on with the "godless" part, mind you. But I can't.

I'm just curious as to how many of us were enrolled in New System School 'private' school and how that experience went. From what I can remember it had nothing to do with what materials were actually learned and everything to do with how many hours your parent recorded you 'studying' for. I was enrolled for 5 years and during that time my mom recorded field service, meetings and studying for meetings as 'school work,' as well as playing in the backyard, going to the beach and on bike rides.

Forgive me for the long post – I am going to try to give the whole back-story for clarity. I have a 17 year old son who is graduating from high school in just a few short weeks. Last winter, he was interested in a girl in another state, talking, texting, etc – and when the relationship fizzled, a new girl seemed to be just waiting there for him. I’ll call her Mary. Mary had been friends with my son for years, and he had often remarked that he found her really attractive, but he was always.

The Watchtower goes to great length to try an demonize any form of religious or nationalistic holiday as saying that they all \ in some form or another\ stem from paganism. The mental gymnastics required to do this is quite frankly laughable in many instances, including the celebration of Thanksgiving, 4th of July, Veterans Day and Presidents Day.

It's because my period is late for many months and I thought all of my pregnancy test kits were somehow false negatives. And my ex-boyfriend who is becoming super PIMI JW that time was not a help at all. He nagged me to have sex with him until I gave in but silently made me feel guilty afterwards. He was also trying to shove all the bOrg's values to me as he expects me to do those and eventually be one of them. Unofficial: JW.ORG - Jehovah's Witnesses. 97K likes.

So I official spoke with my folks a few days ago about how I am leaving the org and do not want anything to do with JWs. That talk went as poorly as you can imagine. Lots of tears and pain but I had to do it. I still break down sometimes thinking about it and think to myself why can't I just suck it up and keep going? But I know I'll never be happy here. So I keep on going. However, I found out that there will be a JC for me. I don't understand why? I already Thanks to the org., it seems I've lost all my friends. Becoming a witness during my teens meant giving up all my "worldly" friends - people from grade school and high school I'd spent more time with during my youth than my own siblings. I was influenced to not spend time with my non-JW family members - siblings, cousins, even my own mother. My conscience made me give up an online "worldly" group of friends I played games with that I got quite close to.

said a fucking asshole JW about my dad. He was diagnosed with demencia and ALS. (Don't care anymore if the details give me away.). This situation is really hard for all of my family (it's the reason why Im still PIMO) especially for my mum. Because of his demencia he also developed a drinking problem. And with all that, my mom tries to continue to be a good JW. She invites people at home (because since my dad is sick, their cong isolates them) and this brother refused because apparantly.

While I was in St. Petersburg, Florida on vacation in February, I got a call from one of the elders of my former congregation “inviting” me to a judicial hearing the following week on the charge of apostasy. I told him that I wouldn’t be back in Canada until near the end of March, so we rescheduled it for April 1 which ironically is “April Fool’s Day”. I asked him to send me a letter with the details of the meeting and he said he would, but then 10 minutes later he called You may download certain events for viewing at a later time.

I am Dutch and an ex-JW (/r/exjw) and currently looking for a job. Recently I responded online to a job opening and in the next step I had to take an online personality test with about 200 questions. Today I had a job interview (went positive) and they shared the results of the test on paper with me. My cult awareness radar immediately noticed the "copyright L.

May I encourage you to take an hour out of your day to attend the memorial tonight. It is unlikely you will know anyone so that should make it easier for you. Even if people have upset you remember that Judas disgustingly betrayed Jesus and the chosen apostles had their faults and fell to bickering. I know that Jehovah and Jesus would be pleased with your efforts if you attend. I think you still believe in a greater force out there in the universe and have respect for the wisdom and prophecies. 
Предыдущее посещение: Чт апр 11, 2019 5:21 am: Текущее время: Чт апр So I had a conversation with a co-worker this morning (he's a JW btw) where I told him that I no longer believed in my church or god. We've worked closely together for years and he was very understanding, but mentioned that I shouldn't just throw out a belief in God with TSCC. His response to an atheist viewpoint was simply, "Ok, make me a blade of grass". Which I thought was a fairly valid point.
